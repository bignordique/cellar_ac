Existing wine cellar cooler is larger than need be, its internal thermostat is broken, and its metal body creates an undesired thermal path between the wine cellar and adjacent boiler room.

This project replaces the existing unit with a "Rigid HVAC micro DC aircon".   This micro DC air conditioner will be located entirely outside the wine cellar, in the adjacent boiler room.   Cooled air and return air are conducted through two ~1.5 inch pipes through an insulation plug in the existing wall easement.

<ul>
<li>Front panel with accomodations for a control panel.</li>
<li>Control system based on an ESP 32 module.
